This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (TensorFlow Vision Projects.ipynb) showcasing a TensorFlow project focused on computer vision, specifically a Dog vs. Cat Classification Model.

Project Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This notebook demonstrates the process of building, compiling, and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images as either "dog" or "cat."

Key Highlights
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TensorFlow & Keras: Utilizes these powerful libraries for deep learning model development.

Image Classification: Focuses on a binary classification task to distinguish between dogs and cats.

Model Training: Includes steps for training the model and saving the trained weights (dog_cat_model.h5).

Getting Started
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

tensorflow

keras (usually installed with TensorFlow)

numpy (often a dependency of other libraries)

You can install TensorFlow via pip:

Bash

pip install tensorflow

How to Run
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Clone this repository or download the TensorFlow Vision Projects.ipynb file.

2. Ensure you have a dataset of dog and cat images organized for training and validation (as expected by ImageDataGenerator if used in the full notebook).

3. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

Bash

jupyter notebook "TensorFlow Vision Projects.ipynb"

4. Execute the cells sequentially to train and experiment with the model.
